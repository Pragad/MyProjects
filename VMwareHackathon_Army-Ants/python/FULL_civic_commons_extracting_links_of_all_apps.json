Led by the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter and the American Planning Association, NY Metro Chapter, the coalition was formed as a volunteer effort by professional design organizations in response to the tragis events of September 11th. Over 400 people participated in the endeavor. The goal was to provide a strategic set of recommendations for rebuilding our city.Our committee was so moved by the possible imminent demise of the cultural organizations affected by September 11th, that we decided to produce a map illustrating the cultural and historical richness of the area that would bring people back downtown to look beyond Ground Zero. We were interested in producing a single document for planning that would enlarge the focus of rebuilding beyond the 16 acres of the World Trade Center Site and to see downtown as a true river-to-river community. The result is the downtownNOW map. First printed in January 2002, the map has been updated and reprinted five times creating 5 unique snapshots of Lower Manhattan showing how it has been transformed since 9/11. It has been widely used by everyone from city planners to schools to residents and tourists and has focussed attention on using culture as a glue for revitalizing communities. Over 500,000 free maps were given away at numerous sites. A version of the downtownNOW map, the downtownWaterfrontNOW map was produced for Lowermanhattan.info ; 150,000 of these maps were given away free.In 2004, cultureNOW began working on its second mapping project, a public art map of Manhattan. The map is meant to celebrate the art that surrounds us that we see everyday. By defining public art as art paid for by a public agency or visible from a public space, we were able to locate over 1500 works of permanent art. The physical map, published in 2007, is supplemented by the over 10,000 searchable images online. In 2008 for openhouseIn 2005, cultureNOW turned its attention uptown to focus on Harlem which is another community in transition. HarlemNOW is the third major mapping project. This project grew out of a semester-long class project in physical planning at Pratt Institute. The physical map was published in 2009; the first copy was given to Governor Patterson on May 9, 2009 at a service event for AmeriCorps in Thomas Jefferson Park. To supplement the physical map, cultureNOW has put together a series of tours of the area. Walking tours were held on Sunday Aug 9th; self guided tours are posted online. cultureNOW has also partnered with the American Institute of Architects NY Chapter Planning and Urban Design Committee to host a symposium, Focus on Harlem: A Community in Transition. cultureNOW has begun recording a series of podcasts by community leaders, journalists, artists and architects who have lived or worked in Harlem that supplement the physical maps."

In contrast to the completely asynchronous, broadcast-to-broadcast mode of existing threaded messaging systems, the Rotisserie adds structure to both the timing and the flow of the discussion. The timing of the discussion is broken into semi-synchronous rounds. Users are allowed to post responses at any time, but their responses are not published to other users until the deadline for the current round passes. This structure allows users to put significant thought into their responses rather than competing with other participants to post first. More important, this structure allows the system to control the flow of the discussion by distributing responses to specific users for further discussion at the end of each round, ensuring that every post is distributed to at least one other user for comment and that each user has exactly one post to which to respond. Lastly, the Rotisserie system includes support for discussion not only within a given class, but also between many different classes at once, allowing, for instance, Internet law classes at HLS and Cambridge to participate in a discussion about digital rights management with an engineering course at MIT."

The current system is flawed because major lots operate at 85% capacity at peak times, and those rates fall to under 20% at evening hours.

Some of them enable you to invite others to contribute. But each marker only has a title and a description field, that's it. What if you want to build a database with more information, like a url for each marker or contact information? Of course you can ask participants to squeeze that into the description field, but that usually gets messy and will require extra manual labor on your end. Or what about updating inaccurate information on other's markers? And finally, what happens if some of the items you are collecting don't have a location? None of these mapping services will allow you to enter items that just appear in a list but not on the map.\u00a0In this scenario you typically have to start developing your own solution. There are great mapping packages out there, like OpenLayers, that you can build upon, but that still requires plenty of coding, not a solution for most of us. Or Drupal is a great platform to build collaborative maps because it supports custom content types and has map modules, but still requires quite a bit of effort to set up even if you are fluent in Drupal.\u00a0\u00a0"

Once they are found, fire fighters must spend precious minutes shoveling out hydrants before they can starting putting out the fire.  With thousands of fire hydrants, most cities simply don't have the resources to shovel them all out. Hence, crowd-sourcing.If one or two people on each block pledged to shovel out a fire hydrant after it snows, the problem would be solved. The Adopt a Hydrant application was designed to coordinate that effort, to ensure that every hydrant in the city has a \u201cparent\u201d to care for it.Much like the fire hydrants it aims to protect, the Adopt a Hydrant software is free for any city to adopt.

This system is subject to a wide range of abuses and manipulations that encourage incumbents to draw districts which protect their seats rather than risk an open contest.By exploring how the system works, as well as how open it is to abuse,\u00a0The Redistricting Game\u00a0allows players to experience the realities of one of the most important (yet least understood) aspects of our political system. The game provides a basic introduction to the redistricting system, allows players to explore the ways in which abuses can undermine the system, and provides info about reform initiatives - including a playable version of the Tanner Reform bill to demonstrate the ways that the system might be made more consistent with tenets of good governance. Beyond playing the game, the web site for\u00a0The Redistricting Game\u00a0provides a wealth of information about redistricting in every state as well as providing hands-on opportunities for civic engagement and political action."

CivicSponsor offers a third option: make elective (not forced) contributions that are earmarked, transparent and audited and that only can be used for new, discrete physical projects. We only work on projects that have no other options: either the local government raises new money, or the projects simply can\u2019t be built. CivicSponsor markets the projects, collects the funds, brings corporate sponsors to the table, and provides the tools to offer transparency and measurement of use of funds in clear terms: square feet of public space built, hours of education funded, etc.\u00a0"

Geocoding an address rather than an entire zip code provides our district matching service with the most precise coordinates possible for consistently accurate results. The majority of other district-matching services either match geocoded ZIP codes to a map of districts or to a list of ZIP codes contained with in a district. In many cases, ZIP code boundaries don\u2019t perfectly nest within legislative district boundaries, particularly in state and local legislative districts, like city councils. Using ZIP code geocoding in these cases returns large numbers of incorrectly matched legislative districts, and consequently the wrong elected officials.Our team of GIS (geographic information systems) analysts and political data researchers closely track election events around the world, making daily updates to the Cicero database as political landscapes change. Not only do we track upcoming elections, we have built an in-depth historic election event data collection to help you compare and analyze the political history of any given country.Access detailed legislative contact information and maps of district boundaries at several levels of legislature:Local - Over 100 local city councils in the United States and CanadaData for each legislator includes:Mailing address informationThe Cicero API also enables you to match your addresses to a variety of non-legislative districts in order for you to better analyze and understand the distribution of your address database. For instance, by matching your constituents' addresses with their school districts, your government or organization can assist families to make more strategic choices by informing them about what schools are available in their districts and how they score nationwide. Or, you might be advocating for preservation efforts in a key watershed in your state. Match your constituents to the watershed they live in and report on how many of them will be directly effected by actions taken there.The Cicero API enables you to match your addresses to a wide variety of non-legislative districts including:CountiesWhether you want to populate constituent records in your database or provide an elected official lookup tool on your website, use the Cicero API for rapid and highly accurate district matching and data population.Local - Over 100 local city councils in the United States and CanadaState - Legislative data for US state house and senate legislatures, Canadian provincial and territorial assemblies, and Australian provincial and territorial assemblies.National - Legislative data for the United States Senate and Congress; Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Scottish Parliaments; The National Assembly of Wales; Northern Ireland AssemblyOther International Data"

Themes are currently only available in India, Brazil and Pakistan.[Each member can become a fan of any of the friends in their list and can also evaluate whether their friend is \"Trustworthy\", \"Cool\", \"Sexy\" on a scale of 1 to 3 (marked by icons) and this is aggregated in terms of a percentage. Unlike Facebook, where a member can view profile details of people only on their network, Orkut allows anyone to visit anyone's profile, unless a potential visitor is on your \"Ignore List\" (this feature has been recently changed so that users can choose between showing their profile to all networks or specified ones). Importantly, each member can also customize their profile preferences and can restrict information that appears on their profile from their friends and/or others (not on the friends list). Another feature is that any member can add any other member on Orkut to his/her \"Crush List\" and both of them will be informed only when both parties have added each other to their \"Crush List\". When a user logs in, they see the people in their friends list in the order of their logging in to the site, the first person being the latest one to do so. Orkut's competitors are other social networking sites including MySpace and Facebook.\u00a0"
