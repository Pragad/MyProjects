++ Project Description
The Project aims to reassemble the haplotypes by linking the reads together. Reads are generated from Haplotypes by a Sequencer and represented as Binary Strings. Representing as binary strings makes computation easier as we only have to care about the positions that vary. But the relationship between the reads and the haplotype is not known, i.e. Which reads come from which haplotype.

So in this project we basically align the reads to a reference genome to find out the SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) positions. The haplotypes from such Read collections are assembled together and we build a greedy algorithm for haplotype phasing from sequence reads. Also it should allow for sequencing errors. 

**Project Understanding**
We have two chromosomes with two kind of variants. Sequencing the chromosomes we get reads from both the chromosomes. So we have two different Reads from two chromosomes. But in reality, the reads get mixed together which makes it difficult to find which reads are from which chromosomes. 

Assemble two haplotypes from the collection of such set of reads.  The key idea is behind the variants present in the Reads. It 
shows that the read is from the same haplotype. i.e. If there exists a reads, T-G from Chromosome 1 then if there is another Read G-C, it indicates that T-G-C are from the same chromosome. This is because G as a link. 

In this project, we aim to identify the haplotypes to which each reads are associated.

++ About Me
I am Pragadheeshwaran Thirumurthi, a Computer Science Master’s student at UCLA. I am interested in Network and Systems. I have a passion towards programming and a willingness to build new applications and systems. 

++ Goals of this Quarter
I have always been interested in Computational Biology. The way how human genomes vary and the various methods involved in analyzing the genomes fascinates me. From this course, I want to gain good understanding of how to solve biological problems using computational techniques and algorithms. My goal for this quarter is to gain more knowledge of solving genomic problems using computational techniques and apply the same to complete this project.
