We refer to haplotype data as
information from each copy of the chromosome and genotype data as information combined
from both copies for an individual.

Flip your slide before done with the sentence
	pause 2secs before switching to presentation
	
Using pictures


either make the slides go point by point so that you can explain each point

how do you generate reads ? Presentation 3 : 14:02

insert random length at random positions

I also parallelized it and these are the results

computational problem - what is the input, what is the output and how you measure the output

baseline method:
	should be a solution to the problem
	
hard to understand what we are trying to do
	explain the problem and the benchmards
		how we would evaluate it, accuracy how fast it is 

Baseline method should be a simpler one
	and then go about explaining your method
	
	and then telling how my method is different from the base line method 
	
	
vary the amount of data and accuracy 
	map as a graphs
	
Lot of different things/ improving etc
	different methods
	Structure the way we describe the method but not the overall presentation
	mixing performance with the method that we do
	first tell what are the methods you tried
Use title in such a way that it helps the body
	
don't write entire sentences as bullets

Haplotype:
The genomes of 2 humans have identical nucleotides at more than 99% of the positions. 
The other positions where variation is observed within a species are called SNPs
For almost all of these SNPs, only two out of the four nucleotides are observed.
So Chromosomes can be iewed as BINARY STRINGS, where each position describes the nucleotides that this individual has at a certain SNP
These binary strings are called HAPLOTYPE.

In case of diploid organisms we have a pair of chromosomes and we would like to obtain two haplotypes per individual.

SINGLE INDIVIDUAL HAPLOTYPING:
	The lab oratory inve s-tigations usually re turn fragments of the two s equences , and our general goal
is to merge the se fragme nts into the two haplotyp e s. T he ?rst main c ompli-cation is that it is not known which fragm ent c ome s from which chrom osome .
Secondly, the m erging pro c ess c an b e disturb ed by meas urem ent errors in the
fragme nts.

To formalis e the problem, haplotyp e fragme nts are de sc rib e d by se que nc es of
the symb ols ’0’, ’1’ and ’-’, whe re a ’-’ is c alle d a hole and denotes that
the fragm ent do e s not give any information ab out this s p ec i?c SNP. A gap in
a haplotyp e fragment is a maximal contiguous blo ck of hole s that is ?anked
on b oth s ides by non- hole s ymb ols . For example, the fragm ent ---0010---has no gaps, -0--10-111 has two gaps, and -0-----1-- has one gap.
The input to Single I ndividual Haplotyping problems is an SNP matrix M
having e ntries from {0 , 1 , -}, with EACH ROW OF THE MATRIX CORRE SP ONDING TO
A HAPLOTYP E FRAGME NT. An input m atrix is s aid to b e gapless if there are no
rows with gaps.

In this c ase , the se two rows are said to con?ict . An
SNP m atrix M is feasible if the rows of M can b e partitioned into two se ts
such that all rows within e ach se t are pairwise non-con?ic ting. If this is the
cas e, the n the re exist two haplotyp e s (binary strings ) s uch that each row of M
do e s not con?ict with at leas t one of the two haplotyp es. On the othe r hand,
when a matrix is not fe asible , then it is s till p oss ible that all fragme nts c ome
from two haplotyp es , if e rrors have b e en made during se que ncing. To mo de l
such errors, de ?ne a ?ip as conve rting a 0 entry to a 1, or vice -versa. The ?rst
concrete problem c ons idered in this thes is is Mini mum Er ror Correction
(MEC), intro duc ed by Gree nb erg e t al. [Gre 04]. The ob je ctive in MEC is to
?ip as few entries of the input matrix as p oss ible to arrive at a feas ible m atrix

--------
Given a set of aligned fragments, Haplotype assembly is the problem of finding the haplotypes ffrom which the fragments have been read.

The haplotype information is very important to many genomic analyses such as the analusis of potential association between certain diseases and genetic variations
Haplotype information is centric to to the study of DNA variation.

We have two haplotypes; We don't know which read comes from which haplotype. So we reassemble to reads to haplotypes
